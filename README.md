# SpaceInvaders
Space Invaders[a] is a 1978 arcade game created by Tomohiro Nishikado. 
It was manufactured and sold by Taito in Japan, and licensed in the United States by the Midway division of Bally.
Within the shooter genre, Space Invaders was the first fixed shooter and set the template for the shoot 'em up genre. 
The goal is to defeat wave after wave of descending aliens with a horizontally moving laser to earn as many points as possible. 
Space Invaders was an immediate commercial success; by 1982, it had grossed $3.8 billion,[6] with a net profit of $450 million, making it the best-selling video game and highest-grossing "entertainment product" at the time.
Adjusted for inflation, the many versions of the game are estimated to have grossed over $13 billion in total revenue as of 2016,[6] making it the highest-grossing video game of all time. 
Space Invaders is considered one of the most influential video games of all time.
It helped expand the video game industry from a novelty to a global industry, and ushered in the golden age of arcade video games.
It was the inspiration for numerous video games and game designers across different genres, and has been ported and re-released in various forms.
The 1980 Atari VCS version quadrupled sales of the VCS, thereby becoming the first killer app for video game consoles. More broadly, the pixelated enemy alien has become a pop culture icon, often representing video games as a whole.
